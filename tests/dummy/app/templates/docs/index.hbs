        Instead of using the standard Google place autocomplete component, which delegates to google the responsibility of adding the UI elements to intereact with place predictions. It is possible to use a Google service that you can call to get the information in JSON format. The service provides more flexibility when communicating with Google Places API. One advantage of usin the service is the possibility to use <strong><i>sessionTokens</i></strong> in order to reduce the cost of paid services when getting places information.
