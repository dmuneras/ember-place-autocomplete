#### requiredDetails

you can defined a variable in you controller to tell the component which google Details you want to display and the style you want to use. Ex:
```js
 export default Ember.Controller.extend({
   requiredDetails: {
    street_number: 'short_name',
     route: 'long_name',
     locality: 'long_name',
     administrative_area_level_1: 'long_name',
     country: 'long_name',
     postal_code: 'short_name'
   }
 });
```
You have two styles:

* 'short_name'
